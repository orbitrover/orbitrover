## Hi there üëã
<ul>
  <li>
    With a solid decade of experience in software development, I bring a wealth of knowledge and a diverse skill set to the table. My expertise spans across ASP.NET Core, Core API, ASP.NET MVC, Web API2, ASP.NET, WCF, JavaScript, jQuery, and Angular-JS. I also excel in UI designing, leveraging HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap along with well-known JQuery-UI for server-side customization. My proficiency extends to supporting tools and languages like Data-Table-JS, Chart-JS, and JQ-grid.
  </li>
  <li>
    I have a proven track record in implementing Messaging Queuing Services, specifically with Kafka and Rabbit-MQ. This experience has equipped me with the ability to design and deploy robust, scalable messaging systems that ensure reliable data transfer between software components.
  </li>
  <li>
    My deep understanding of MicroServices development is underpinned by a strong foundation in Design Patterns, the S.O.L.I.D. Principle, and OOPs Concepts. I am adept at implementing Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and designing systems based on SOA (Service-oriented architecture) and REST architecture design.
  </li>
  <li>
    In addition, I have significant exposure to implementing payment frameworks through various banks, wallets, and loyalty systems. My four-year experience in developing prepaid card-based payment systems (POS payment solutions, Loyalty solutions) for some of India‚Äôs largest petroleum companies is a testament to my capabilities in this domain.
  </li>
  <li>
    A firm believer in agile development in SDLC with TDD/BDD fashion, I am known for my excellent communication skills, quick learning ability, and being a team player with a consistently positive attitude. My mantra is simple - ‚Äúget the work done‚Äù.
  </li>
  <li>
    I bring to the table strong expertise in Requirement Gathering, Impact Analysis, Solution Providing, Presenting, and Documenting. This comprehensive skill set enables me to understand client needs, analyze the impact of solutions, provide effective solutions, present ideas clearly, and document processes meticulously.
  </li>
  <li>
    On a personal note, I am open, candid, and modest. I thrive on sharing knowledge and learning from others, and my passion for technology and programming is unwavering. This blend of technical prowess and personal qualities makes me a valuable asset to any team.
